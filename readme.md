# Quantum Computing Project

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/peterbell10/QuantumComputing.svg?token=zaY34REqpumj7ELM4AiG&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/peterbell10/QuantumComputing)

## Documentation

The documentation found in the docs folder must first be built by sphinx
using the command `make html`. Prebuilt documentation is also given in the
folder prebuilt_docs.

The documentation is in the form of a website which should be opened by the
file `index.html`.

## Requirements

The project requirements can be installed by running the command

    pip install -r requirements.txt

## Running tests

The tests must be run with the tests folder as the current working directory.
Then simply run `pytest` (or maybe `py.test` depending on version).
